# Finding the Center Point from UTM Coordinates in PHP
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) is a global map projection system used for representing the Earth's surface. It divides the Earth into a series of 6Â° longitudinal zones, each with its own coordinate system. The UTM system provides a set of Easting (X) and Northing (Y) coordinates to define a specific location within a given zone.

Finding the "center point" within a specific area of interest may refer to determining the central UTM coordinates for a set of UTM points, such as a polygon or a series of GPS waypoints. This document outlines a function to compute the center point (often referred to as the centroid) from UTM coordinates.
